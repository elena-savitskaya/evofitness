# EvoFitness

This project is a fitness web application built with TypeScript using React and Vite. The project utilizes TailwindCSS for styling and Framer Motion for animations.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
```
## Project Structure
- **React** — Library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript** — Strictly typed JavaScript for reliable code.
- **Vite** — Fast build and development tool.
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Framer Motion** — Animation library.
- **ESLint & Prettier** — Tools for maintaining code quality.

## Development Best Practices
### ESLint: Ensures that your code follows consistent style and avoids bugs.
### Prettier: Automatically formats your code according to a consistent style.
### TypeScript: Type checking ensures that the code is reliable and catches errors during development.
### GitHub Actions
### Consider setting up GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI) to automatically lint, test, and deploy your application whenever changes are made.
